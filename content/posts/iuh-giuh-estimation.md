## Introduction



The instantaneous unit hydrograph IUH/GIUH estimation under the simplifying assumption that rainfall inputs are given as a discrete sequence of rain impulses. This, more than being a simplification, is related to the discrete nature of rain at small time scales of aggregation and has a physical basis (e.g. ( <cite>Lovejoy 1985[^1]</cite> )).
