<div style="text-align:justify;"> Floods can have catastrophic consequences and can have effects on the economy, environment and people. It initiates comprehensive assessment and forecasting of possible flooding events, which is typically carried out using hydrological models. Thus, the main objective of this study was to present a distributed hydrological model, namely Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model for simulating the hydrological variables over Krishna River Basin, India and evaluating its performance by comparing with observed datasets. The main advantages of the VIC model compared to other physically based hydrological models, are the variable infiltration curve, which implementsa nonlinear function of the fractional grid cell area to scale the maximum infiltration for enabling runoff calculations for sub grid-scale areas and the parameterization of baseflow using a nonlinear recession curve. Meteorological forcingsat 0.5 degree by 0.5 degree spatial resolution from 1980 to 2005 over the basin were used to run the model at a daily time step. The model showed an acceptable performance during calibration and validation with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)=0.34 and coefficient of determination (R²)=0.60 for calibration and NSE=0.42 and R²=0.68 for validation periods. The results from VIC model shows that it canhandle large-scale variability. However,it has a tendency to overestimate the streamflow in the downstream portion possibly due to not considering the effect of storage structures in the present model. </div>
