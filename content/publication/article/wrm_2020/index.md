<div style="text-align:justify;"> Quantification of water-budget components is an essential step in the planning andmanagement of water resources in any river basin. Recently several studies emphasizedthat climate change would inevitably affect terrestrial hydrology. This study appliesdistributed hydrological modeling using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) modelto simulate the water balance components in the Sina basin, a drought-prone region inIndia. We analyzed the long-term spatiotemporal dynamics of precipitation, evapotrans-piration, surface runoff, and baseflow components, and their alterations due to impendingclimate change. The study employed the Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimators toanalyze the spatiotemporal trends of the water balance components during the baseline(1980–2010) and for the near future (2019–2040) periods. For the baseline period,precipitation exhibited an increasing trend, particularly during the monsoon season. Onthe evaluation of the annual water balance components, it showed that the basin has a lowannual rainfall (~ 718 mm) and relatively a very high annual evapotranspiration (~ 572mm) during 1980–2010, which might be the main reason for frequent droughts in thestudy basin. Further, for analyzing the climate change impacts on the water budget in theSina basin, the VIC model was forced with outputs from a set of global climate modelsfornearfuture(2019–2040) for two emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Analysis ofthe results revealed that the water balance components in the near future would benegatively affected by climate change despite their increasing pattern in the baselineperiod. In comparison to the baseline (1980–2010), the surface runoff would decrease byas much as 32% for the near future, which stresses for planning and adaptation ofappropriate mitigation measures in the basin. </div>
